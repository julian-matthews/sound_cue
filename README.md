# `SOUND_CUE` function

This MATLAB function triggers a sound when a specified key is pressed. Cue delay is manipulated such that the sound triggers either immediately or after a short delay (*default = 5 seconds*).

### How to use
Place a .wav file within the `sound_cue` folder using the name `cued_sound.wav`. If an audio file isn't found the script will notify the user.

### Mods
Check the top of the script for simple modifications such as delay time, echoing and randomisation parameters.
